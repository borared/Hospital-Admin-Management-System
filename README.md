## 🏥 Hospital Admin Management System


## ✨ I. Introduction

The Hospital Admin Management System is an object-oriented software application designed to help hospital administrators manage core hospital operations efficiently. The system focuses on managing doctors, patients, departments, and appointments through a centralized admin-controlled platform.

## ✨ II. Problem Statement

Traditional hospital record keeping systems are often manual, time consuming that easily cause any error. Managing patient records, doctor details, and appointment schedules manually can lead to data inconsistency and inefficiency. This project aims to solve these problems by providing a structured, secure, and efficient digital management system.

## ✨ III. Objectives
- To develop an admin-controlled hospital management system
- To manage doctor and patient records efficiently
- To schedule and manage appointments
- To apply Object Oriented Programming concept
- To improve data accuracy and accessibility


## ✨ IV. Proposed System Features
- Admin login and authentication
- Doctor management (Add, Update, Delete, View)
- Patient management (Add, Update, Delete, View)
- Department management
- Appointment scheduling and cancellation
- Search and report generation


## ✨ V. Technology Used
- Programming Language: Object Oriented Language (Java)
- Development Type: Console-based 
- Data Storage: File handling or database


## ✨ VI. OOP Concepts Applied
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Composition

## ✨ VII. Conclusion

The Hospital Admin Management System will provide a structured and efficient way to manage hospital operations. This project will enhance practical understanding of object oriented programming and real world software design.
